Alpha version of a runtime mapping configuration for AutoMapper


## Description
The proposal is to provide the ability to create mapping configurations at runtime, in other words, remove the need for manual mapping configurations.

There will probably be some limitations and those will be given by the fact that only streamline mappings can be supported without any other metadata. This is a **common sense** limitation
